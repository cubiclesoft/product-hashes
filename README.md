CubicleSoft Product Hashes
==========================

For commercial CubicleSoft software products, this repository contains the latest release JSON files containing multiple file hashes for the latest associated major version downloads.  Using GitHub allows for secure, third-party storage of hash information about release binaries.

Note that you may have to be logged into the associated Product Support Center for the relevant product to download the files.  Use the Product Support Center API to first login and then to initiate the download using the information from the JSON file when performing automation.
